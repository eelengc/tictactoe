Approach: <br/>
Design a grid of 3x3 using CSS Grid and allow players to key in their names to represent themselves during the game.
Each grid box is declared a variable and a class of the player's character is added to the specific box whenever it is clicked, using classlist property, target event property as well as event listeners and event handlers. Build on the winning combinations for player to win or have the game tied when all boxes are occupied. Display the game status and allow players to choose to play again or reset a new game through buttons(event listeners).
